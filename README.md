### ‚á® Note
The code is unofficial, forked from <a href="https://github.com/Dapunta/AutoCreateFB">AutoCreateFB</a>.
**Mr.Dapunta** has full access to this code, we just added some necessary elements to make the code more tailored to your bot's needs.

Greetz to Mr.Dapunta, and You‚ô•Ô∏è.

### ‚á® Changelog

- Fixed several `TypeError issues: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable.`

- Added several additional customized account activity elements to make the output appear more lively. (You can adjust the bot's target settings in the source code to suit your needs.)

- Implemented the option to generate random names from various available countries, including:
  - United States of America [US]
  - India                    [IN]
  - Indonesia                [ID]
  - Pakistan                 [PK]
  - Russia                   [RU]
  - Japan                    [JP]
  - China                    [CN]
  - Zimbabwe                 [ZW]
  - Spain                    [ES]
  - Brazil                   [BR]
  
  (You can modify and edit the list of names in `names.py` according to your requirements.)

- I made some slight modifications to the appearance, excluding the banner. The banner serves as Mr.Dapunta's personal identification, and I hope you understand that it shouldn't be altered.

- Trimmed unnecessary code that doesn't contribute significantly to the code's execution. (This is my mistake and not recommended to be imitated. However, it seems that Mr.Dapunta doesn't mind it, isn't it? Idk, I apologize for that.)
